# simple-stock-check
A simple web scrawler java program that checks a list of URLs, views the HTML, and looks for phrases like, "out of stock". If such phrases are found, the program will keep periodically cycling the list until such phrases are not found on the page. In this case, an email will be sent to you notifying you that the item is back in stock.
